program description:
handle the access to the files, and when a request for a file is recieved, the program will return the file contents

PSEUDOCODE
Get all the files in the data folder, create a String ArrayList of them and index them properly, so there are three private variables:
the folder the file lists are stored, a File; the fileList, a String ArrayList; the numbering to the fileList, a String ArrayList
create methods to initialize the three variables to load the file list in order, and get the file list; generate the indexing, get the index, and read the specific indexed file content
Also deal with the errors related to the data folder, if the data folder does not exists, empty; and when the index of the file list is out of bounds they want to
Testing covering all the cases

UML
Class FileHandler
---------------------
-folder:File
-fileList：ArrayList<String>
-numbering: ArrayList<String>
---------------------
+FileHandler()
+FileHandler(folder: File)
----------------------
+getFileList():ArrayList<String>
+loadFileList(): void
+getNumbering():ArrayList<String>
+generateNumbering():void
+readContent(index: int): String

TEST
case 1: loadFileList() and getFileList() work successfully
case 2: when the "data" folder we don't have access to read or does not exist, loadFileList() will return a message
case 3: when the data folder is empty, loadFileList() will return a message
case 4: generateNumbering() and getNumbering() work successfully when the total number is one digit
case 5: generateNumbering() and getNumbering() work successfully when the total number is two digit
case 6: generateNumbering() and getNumbering() work succesffuly when the total number is three digit
case 7: readContent() works successfully
case 8: the index input in readContent() is out of bounds.
